/**
 * Counting rules.
 *
 * 0. Initially points = 0.
 * 1. If a friend is not available then points = 0.
 * 2. points += calls
 * 3. For each network:
 *    points += 1 if "low"
 *    points += 2 if "moderate"
 *    points += 3 if "high"
 * 4. For each meeting:
 *    points += 2 + 1 / F, where F is a number of friends in a meeting
 * 5. points += time
 * 6. points += travels
 * 7. For initiative:
 *    points += 1 if "other"
 *    points += 2 if "both"
 *    points += 3 if "either"
